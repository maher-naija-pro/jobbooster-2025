## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 2. API Endpoint

The CV analysis API endpoint is available at:
- **POST** `/api/analyze-cv`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "cvData": {
    "id": "string",
    "filename": "string",
    "experience": [...],
    "education": [...],
    "processedContent": "string"
  },
  "jobOffer": "string",
  "language": {
    "code": "string",
    "name": "string"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json

  "result": {
    "analysis": {
      "skills": [...],
      "experience": [...],
      "education": [...],
      "strengths": [...],

      "skillMatches": [...],
      "missingSkills": [...],
      "recommendations": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

## State Management

### New State Properties
- `cvAnalysis: CVAnalysisResult | null`
- `isAnalyzingCV: boolean`
- `cvAnalysisProgress: number`

### New Actions
- `SET_CV_ANALYSIS`
- `CLEAR_CV_ANALYSIS`
- `START_CV_ANALYSIS`
- `SET_CV_ANALYSIS_PROGRESS`
- `STOP_CV_ANALYSIS`

## UI Integration

### Components Added
1. **CVAnalysisDisplay** - Main analysis results component
2. **Enhanced ActionButtons** - Added "Analyze CV" button
3. **Updated Page Layout** - Conditional rendering based on analysis state

### User Flow
1. User uploads CV and enters job offer
2. Clicks "Analyze CV" button
3. System shows progress indicator
4. Analysis results displayed in tabbed interface
5. User can regenerate or download results

## State Machine Integration

The CV analysis feature follows the existing state machine pattern:

```
Initial → CV Ready + Job Ready → Ready to Analyze → Analyzing → Analysis Complete
```

## Error Handling

- API key validation
- Network error handling
- Invalid response format handling
- User-friendly error messages

## Performance Considerations

- AI analysis typically takes 2-5 seconds
- Progress indicators provide user feedback
- Results are cached in state for quick access
- Regenerate functionality allows for re-analysis

## Future Enhancements

- Export analysis to PDF/Word
- Save analysis history
- Compare multiple CVs
- Industry-specific analysis templates
- Integration with job boards
