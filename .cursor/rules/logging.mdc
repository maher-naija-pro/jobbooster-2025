# Logging Development Rules

## Core Principles
add max logs 
- **Use structured logging** for all server-side operations

- **Include correlation IDs** for request tracing and debugging
- **Use appropriate log levels** based on severity and context
- **Ensure logs are searchable and analyzable** in production environments

## Log Levels and Usage

### Log Level Hierarchy
1. **ERROR**: Application errors, exceptions, and failures
2. **WARN**: Warning conditions that don't stop execution
3. **INFO**: General application flow and important events
4. **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging information
5. **TRACE**: Very detailed debugging information
