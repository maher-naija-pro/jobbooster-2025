# Top 10 Best Practices for Readable and Maintainable Code

1. **Use Clear, Descriptive Names**  
   Name variables, functions, and classes so their purpose is obvious. Avoid abbreviations and single-letter names (except for loop counters).

4. **Extract Magic Numbers and Strings to Constants**  
   Replace hard-coded values with named constants to clarify their meaning and make updates easier.
