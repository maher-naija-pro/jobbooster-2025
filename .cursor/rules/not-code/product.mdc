# Product Management - Feature Definition Excellence

## Role and Responsibilities
As a Product Manager/Product Owner, your role is to define clear, precise, and actionable features that development teams and AI can easily understand and implement.

## Industry Standards and Best Practices

### 2. **User Experience (UX) Principles**
- **User-Centered Design** : Focus on user needs and pain points
- **Accessibility** : Ensure features work for all users (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **Mobile-First** : Design for mobile devices first
- **Performance** : Define acceptable loading times and response rates

define detailed technical integration on this stack 

### 3. **Technical Excellence**
- **Scalability** : Consider future growth and performance
- **Security** : Identify security requirements and compliance needs
- **Integration** : Plan for API design and third-party integrations
- **Monitoring** : Define observability and alerting requirements

## Standard Feature Template

### 1. **Feature Statement**
```
## [Feature Name]
**As a** [user type]
**I want** [feature description]
**So that** [benefit/outcome]
```

### 2. **Context and Justification**
- **Why** this feature is necessary
- **What problem** it solves
- **What value** it delivers
- **Business impact** and ROI

### 3. **Acceptance Criteria (AC)**
Use SMART framework:
- **Specific** : Precise and unambiguous description
- **Measurable** : Verifiable criteria
- **Actionable** : Concrete actions to implement
- **Realistic** : Technically feasible
- **Time-bound** : With defined timeline

### 4. **Definition of Done (DoD)**
- [ ] Code developed and tested
- [ ] Unit and integration tests pass
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to test environment
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified

## Enhanced Writing Best Practices

### Language and Clarity
- **Use action verbs** : "User can", "System must", "Application displays"
- **Avoid ambiguity** : Prefer "User clicks the 'Save' button" over "User saves"
- **Define metrics** : "Page loads in under 2 seconds"
- **Specify conditions** : "When user is logged in AND has admin privileges"

### Acceptance Criteria Structure
```
Acceptance Criteria AC-[N]:
- **Statement** : [Clear description of what must be done]
- **Conditions** : [When/how this is triggered]
- **Expected Result** : [What should happen]
- **Validation Criteria** : [How to verify completion]
- **Edge Cases** : [Unusual scenarios to handle]
```

### Concrete Examples
- **Good** : "User receives an email notification immediately after account creation"
- **Bad** : "User is notified of account creation"
- **Better** : "User receives an email notification within 30 seconds of account creation, containing their username and a welcome message"

## Advanced Techniques

### **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**
```gherkin
Feature: Push Notifications
  Scenario: User receives notification for new message
    Given a user is logged in
    And has enabled push notifications
    When a new message is created
    Then the user receives a push notification within 5 seconds
    And the notification contains the message title
    And tapping the notification opens the app
```

### **Impact Mapping**
- **Goal** : Increase user engagement
- **Actors** : Logged-in users, message creators
- **Impacts** : Faster information sharing, improved responsiveness
- **Deliverables** : Push notification system, preference management

### **Technical Debt Considerations**
- **Code Quality** : Maintain high test coverage
- **Performance** : Monitor notification delivery times
- **Scalability** : Plan for user growth
- **Maintenance** : Regular dependency updates

This enhanced rule provides a comprehensive framework for defining features that meet industry standards and can be easily understood and implemented by development teams and AI systems.
