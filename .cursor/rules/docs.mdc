# Documentation Development Rules

## Core Principles
- **Use clear, concise language** - avoid jargon and technical debt
- **Include examples and use cases** - show, don't just tell
- **Document the "why" not just the "what"** - explain decisions and trade-offs
- [ ] **Dependencies**: All dependencies and imports are documented
